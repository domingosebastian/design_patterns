Our LocalBank banking application is earning millions of dollars a day thanks
to its sophisticated functionality.

This functionality is represented in the LocalBank interface and implemented in the class.
LocalBankImpl.

For its international expansion we need that our clients can access the functionality
implemented in LocalBankImpl from the standard interface InternationalMoneyOrganization.

We want to do this without changing anything about our LocalBankImpl class or, of course, about our
LocalBank interface.

To test your code use the test that you will find in:
test / edu / pattern / adapter / InternationalMoneyTests.java
