We want to create a Factory that uses the factory method pattern to centralize 
the creation logic of a washing machine.

Note the test: you will see that the two types of washing machines (front loading and top loading), 
have a lot in common in the process of their creation.

Create the required factory and adapt the test for use in both tests.
