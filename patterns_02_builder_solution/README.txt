This exercise is to provide two
specific builders, as discussed in the lesson: one for adults and one for minors.

Contruct these builders in the Person class.

You can use the Main class to know what methods these builders are expected to have.
 
  Notice that the Main class has two blocks of commented code. The first block must
  compile correctly after the exercise. However, the second block should NOT
  compile since we are specifically trying to avoid these type of inconsistencies (adults that go to school).
