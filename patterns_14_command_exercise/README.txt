In this exercise we will continue with the example seen in the lesson.

Look at the two implementations of PackageProcessing: MultiplePackageProcessing and DangerousPackage.
Each one receives in the constructor the type of order that it can process and implements the process () method.

In the test you will find the instructions: create a new implementation called InternationalPackageProcessing that accepts all requests except those going to Mordor (more details in the test)

This is too easy, huh? ;-)
